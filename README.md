Start In Dayton
========
A starting conversation point for Code For Dayton's Startup In A Day project.

It's rough, contains placeholder images and text, but it is more meant to drive conversation about the project.

* What do we want to build?
* Is it better to build a few small utilities or some OpenCounter-esque system?
* What does it make sense for us to build?
